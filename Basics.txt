Dynamically typed and Statically typed language.
Dynamically-typed languages perform type checking at runtime, while statically typed
	languages perform type checking at compile time. This means that scripts written
	in dynamically-typed languages (like Groovy) can compile even if they contain
	errors that will prevent the script from running properly (if at all).
	If a script written in a statically-typed language (such as Java) contains errors,
	it will fail to compile until the errors have been fixed.

First class function :-
	A programming language is said to have First-class functions when functions in that 
		language are treated like any other variable. For example, in such a language, 
		a function can be passed as an argument to other functions, can be returned by
		another function and can be assigned as a value to a variable.
	- Python has first class functions.


Python
- Python is Interpreted language it executes the code line by line and
	stops if an error occurs in any line.
- Python is dynamically typed that mean developer does not assign data types
	at the time of coding. It automatically gets assigned during execution.
- Python is case sensative language.

- Features:-
	- Easy to use.
	- Free and open-source
	- Extensive support for libraries

What is PEP 8?
- PEP 8 stands for Python Enhancement Proposal.
- It is document that helps us to provide the guidelines on how to write the Python code.
- It is set of rules that specify how to format Python code for maximum readability.


- How python program is executed :-
	- We save code in .py file
	- Compilation :-
		- Python compiler verifies synxtax and generate byte code(.pyc file)
			 if syntax is okay.
		- Byte code are intermediate instructions. Hence no OS can
			understand this.	
	- Linking
		-  python interpreter i.e Python Virtual Machine(PVM) converts the
			python byte code into machine-executable code.

	- Python programs are both compiled as well as interpreted, but the	
		compilation part is hidden from the programmer. Therefore, we generally say, 
		Python is an interpreted language for the same reason.

Difference between python2 and python3

- we have print as statement in py2 and print() as function in py3.
- Python 3 doesn't contain the xrange() function of Python 2.
- We have raw_input() in py2 and input() in py3 for user input.

Difference between python and java
- Python is very easy and have less lines of code.
- We dont need any method and class to write simple python program.
- We dont have curly bracket insted we use indentation in py.
- Python was invented by Guido van Rossum in 1991.


Where is Python used?
- Data Science
- Machine Learning and AI
- Web Applications flask, django
- Computer Vision or Image Processing Applications.
- Speech Recognitions

Python Popular Frameworks and Libraries
- Web development (Server-side) - Django Flask, Pyramid, CherryPy
- GUIs based applications - Tk, PyGTK, PyQt, PyJs, etc.
- Machine Learning - TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, Scipy, etc.
- Mathematics - Numpy, Pandas, etc.

In python single quotes are used for regular expressions, dict keys
or SQL where as double quotes are used for string representation.

What is the difference between .py and .pyc files?

What is suit in python :-
	- Group of statement which are inside certain block.
	- Number of statements inside for block can be called suite.

What are different types of function:-
	1) Required Arguments :-
		- We need to pass argument in same order
		- here `add(num1, num2=12):` num1 is required argument.
	2) Keyword Arguments :-
		- We need to pass argument with keywords.
		- here `add(num1, num2=12):` num1 anf num2 are keywords.
	3) Default Agruments :-
		- We need to assign default value certain argument.
		- Non-default arguments are specified before the default arguments.
		- The default arguments are specified at the end
		- here `add(num1, num2=12):` num2 is default argument.
	4) Arbitrary/Variable Arguments :-
		- We can pass any number of argument and access them with for loop inside func.
		- We use *args and **kwrgs for this functions.

Tokens in python :-
	There are following tokens in Python:
		1) Keywords.
		2) Identifiers.
		3) Literals.
		4) Operators.

Python Keywords :-
- 1. global keyword is used to declare global variables inside function.
		- When variables are declared inside function they are local variables
		- And those in file scope are global variables, which means they can be
			accessed anywhere.

- 2. del keyword is used to delete the declared variables.
		- If we access variable after deleting we get `name not defined error`.
		- Syntax is del <variable>

- 3.  self is used to represent the instance of the class.
		- We can access the attributes and methods of the class with self Keyword.

- Difference between Break, Continue, Pass
	- a) break - It terminates the loop immediately and the control flows to the 
					statement after the body of the loop.
	- b) continue - It terminates the current iteration of the statement, skips the 
					rest of the code in the current iteration and the control flows
					to the next iteration of the loop.
	- c) pass - It  is generally used to fill up empty blocks and is similar to an 
				empty statement represented by a semi-colon in languages such as Java

Python DataTypes
- Numeric
	- Python support three types of numeric data types.
		- Integer - Python has no restriction on the length of an integer.
		- float
		- Complex Number

- Sequence Type
	- The concatenation operator (+) and repetition operator (*) works with the Sequences
		1) String - String is the collection of the characters surrounded by single quotes
					double quotes, or triple quotes.
				  - Strings are immutable in python.
				  - String can completely replaced by other but we cannot partially
						reassign its content.
				  - We can format string using `"hi {}".format("Vaibhav")`,
					 "Hello {variable_name}" and "hi %s"%("Vaibhav)

		2) List - The lists are ordered collection of elements of different data types.
				- List elements can be accessed by the assigned index.
				- 

		3) Tuple - A tuple is a read-only data structure as we can't modify the size 
					and value of the items of a tuple.
				- Tuple can have duplicate values.
				- It is immutable and and ordered data structure
				- It is similar to list.
				- We can create tuple without using parentheses.
				- We need to add comma after 1st element to create single element tuple
				 	single_tuple = ("Tuple",)
				- We cannot delete single element of tuple but we can delete it completely

	Difference between list and tuple
		- list is mutable whereas tuple is not.
		- List is better for performing operations like insertion and deletion
		- Tuple is better for accessing elements.
		- list consumes more memory, Tuple consumes less memory.

	Difference between list and set
		- list is order collection of datatype, where is set is unordered.
		- list can have duplicate, set cannot have duplicate elements.
		- 

- Dictionary - Dictionary is an unordered set of a key-value pair of items. 
			 - While fetching key-value from dict, we may not get data in 
				same order which we have inserted.
			 - We cannot have duplicate key, But we can have duplicate value.
			 - The keys are immutable in dictionary.
			 - Python has built in function dict() to create dictionary.
				or we can use {}.
			 - values from dictionary can be accessed by keys or we have get()
				method to do so.
			 -  Items of the dictionary can be deleted by using the del keyword.
			 - pop() method accepts the key as an argument and remove the 
				associated value.
			 -  popitem() and clear() method for remove elements from the dictionary.
			 - we cannot store multiple values for the same keys.

- Set -   Python Set is the unordered collection of the data type.
		- It has unique elements.
		- Set is mutable but its elements are immutable.
		- It will not have duplicate values.
		- There is no index attached to the elements of the set.
		- In set, the order of the elements is undefined;
		- We can use set for week days.
		- We need to use set() function to create empty set.
			empty curly braces creates empty dictionary.
		- remove method throws error if element is not found whereas discard will not.
		- print(Days1|Days2) is union operator or we have union() method.
		- and & for intersection or intersection() function.


		FrozenSets
			- It is the immutable form of the normal sets.
			- Since elements are immutable  they can be used as a key in the dictionary.
			- frozenset() method is used to create the frozenset object.
			- If we pass the dictionary as the sequence inside the frozenset() method,
			   it will take only the keys from the dictionary and returns a frozenset

- Boolean
	- & is bitwise AND.
	- AND is logical AND.

	- 0 is treated as False and
	- 1 is treated as True in python. --> 1==True is True.
	- True+10 is 11 since True is 1.

- Above are common built-in data types in Python.

Python Data Structures
- Python provides built-in data structures such as list, tuple,
	dictionary, and set.

Mutable :- List, Set, Dictionary
Immutable :- integer, string, float, tuple, and bool.

- mutable means it can be modified after its creation.
- immutable --> assigned value cannot be changed.

Python Literals
	- Literals can be defined as data that is given in a variable or constant.
	- Types of Strings:
			- Single-line String - terminated in single line.
			- Multi-line String - text that is written in multiple lines
				e.g text1='hello\    
							user' 
				- We use \ to write multi-line string.
				- we can use triple quotes to write multiline comment.

	- Python contains one special literal i.e., None.   

- in and not in are membership operators in python.
- is and not is are identity operators.


Why Python string is immutable?
- In Python, strings are made immutable so that programmers cannot
	alter the contents of the object (even by mistake).
	This avoids unnecessary bugs.

- Security - database username, password are passed as String to get
	database connection and in socket programming host and port details
	passed as String. Since String is immutable, its value can’t be
	changed otherwise any hacker could change the referenced value to
	cause security issues in the application.

Python is and ==
	- In python is is used for reference comparison where as == is used for
		value comparison.
	- In java == is used for reference comparison whereas equals is used for
		value comparison.

- We can use `in` keyword on any data type with the __contains__() method.


Anonymous Functions/lambda functions
	- Functions are called anonymous because we do not declare them.
	- We can use the lambda keyword to define these functions.
	- lambda functions accepts unlimited number of arguments; but returns
		only one value.
	-  an anonymous function cannot be directly called to print.


Python Magic/Dunder Methods
- Magic methods are those which have two underscore as prefix and suffix.
- e.g. __init__, __add__, __repr__
- __init__ is a contructor method in Python and is automatically called
	to allocate memory when a new object/instance is created.

Python Iterator
- It is object that can be used to iterate over iterables like list,tuple,dict.
- It has two methods __iter__() and __next__()
-  We use __next__() method to print value from generator

Python Generators
- Generators are same as function but insted of return we use yeild in generators.
- We can have multiple yeild inside function.

Python Decorators
- With decorators we can add extra feature in existing function.
- Decorators allows us to wrap another function to extend behaviour of wrapped function
	without permanently modifying it.
- Function are first class objects in python that mean they can be assigned to variables,
	returned from other functions and passed into functions.
- Classes are also first class objects.
- We can pass function as parameter and return function as well.

Shallow and Deep Copy
- Shallow Copy stores the copy of the original object and points the 
	references to the objects.
- Deep copy stores the copy of the original object and recursively 
	copies the objects as well.
- In shallow copy changes made to the new/copied object are reflected
	in the original object.
- Deep copy doesn’t reflect changes made to the new/copied object 
	in the original object.


Object Serialization and Deserialization or Pickling and Unpickling
- It is process of converting state of an object into byte stream.
- This byte stream can further be stored in any file or It can also be transmitted via sockets.
- Deserialization is the process of reconstructing the object from the byte stream.
- In python we have pickle module.


Difference between Python Arrays and lists?
- Arrays
	- Arrays in python can only contain elements of same data types.
	-  It is a wrapper around C language arrays and consumes far less memory than lists.
- Lists
	- Lists in python can contain elements of different data types.
	- It has the disadvantage of consuming large memory.


How is memory managed in Python?
- Memory management in Python is handled by the Python Memory Manager.
- The memory allocated by the manager is in form of a private heap space
	dedicated to Python.
- All Python objects are stored in this heap and being private, 
	it is inaccessible to the programmer.
- Python has an in-built garbage collection to recycle the unused memory
	for the private heap space.

What is Scope Resolution in Python?
- Sometimes objects within the same scope have the same name but function differently.
- In such cases, scope resolution comes into play
- Python automatically handles this.

What does *args and **kwargs mean?
- *args 
	- It is a special syntax used in the function definition to pass
		variable-length arguments.
	- We can pass any number of arguments separated by commas.
	- * means variable length and “args” is the name used by convention.
	- args is tuple of values.
	- args is just variable name. we can use anything over there.

- **kwargs
	- **kwargs is a special syntax used in the function definition to pass 
		variable-length keyworded arguments.
	- We can pass any number of arguments with keyword --> e.g someFunc(key="null")s
	- kwargs is used just by convention. You can use any other name.
	- Keyworded argument means a variable that has a name when passed to a function.
	- It is actually a dictionary of the variable names and its value.

What are access specifiers used in python?
- Python does not make use of access specifiers specifically like private, public,
	protected, etc.
- But we can use single underscore for protected and double underscore private variables
- By default, the variables without prefixed underscores are public.

How will you check if a class is a child of another class?
- We have issubclass() method.
- Method tells us if any class is a child of another class by returning boolean value.
- print(issubclass(Child, Parent))    #True

What is Python's parameter passing mechanism?
- Pass by references
	- By default, all the parameters are passed "by reference" to the functions.
	- If we change value of the parameter within a function the change is reflected
		everywhere.

- Pass by Value
	- Here we only pass value, No referece.
	- If value is changed within function then change remain within function scope.
	- Original value isnt change.
	- It makes variable immutable that means not changeable.

Difference between Iterator and Generators
- Basic :-
	Iterable --> like list, tuple, set --> Data structure that we can iterate through.
			--> We have __iter__() or __getitem__() method inside this.
	Iterator --> An iterator is an object that can be used to  traverse through 
					all the values of iterable.
			--> It has two methods __iter__() and __next__().
	Generator --> It is another way of creating iterators.
			  --> in a simple way it uses the keyword “yield” instead of returning

- Class is used to implement an iterator	Function is used to implement a generator.
- Local Variables aren’t used here.  All the local variables before the yield function are stored.
- Iterator uses iter() and next() functions  Generator uses yield keyword
- Every iterator is not a generator Every generator is an iterator
